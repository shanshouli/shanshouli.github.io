  description: <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> ML Pipeline Optimization, Model Fine-tuning, 
               LayoutLMv3, Table Transformer, AWS, Label Studio
               <br><br>
               • Developed and fine-tuned an AI-powered document processing pipeline using 
               LayoutLMv3 and Table Transformer to extract structured data from scanned 
               medical-device bill sheets; improved field extraction accuracy by 25%, 
               reduced manual review time by 40%, and accelerated billing automation
               <br><br>
               • Built annotation workflows and error-reporting processes for 3,000+ scanned 
               bill sheets, uncovering key OCR failure patterns and guiding model retraining; 
               improved data pipeline accuracy to 95%+, reducing manual correction efforts by 30%

               <br><br>
               • Spearheaded a large-scale backend refactor initiative, decomposing a 7,700+ LOC 
               monolithic app with 58 tightly coupled endpoints into a modular architecture; 
               reduced weekly merge conflicts by 50% and accelerated feature delivery
               <br><br>
               • Developed a CI/CD pipeline with k6 smoke testing, Prometheus and Grafana dashboards; 
               enabled performance trend tracking and automated alerts
               <br><br>
               • Built and deployed a RAG microservice using LangChain to process unstructured and 
               tabular data, generate embeddings, and construct a knowledge graph; cut data retrieval 
               time by 40%
               <br><br>
               • Reduced token cost by 44% via Helicone monitoring, intent-based model routing, 
               and Redis caching; leveraged RAGAS and prompt tuning to boost answer faithfulness 
               and context precision
