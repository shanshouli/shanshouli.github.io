               <br><br>
               • Spearheaded a large-scale backend refactor initiative, decomposing a 7,700+ LOC monolithic app with 58 tightly coupled endpoints into a modular architecture; reduced weekly merge conflicts by 50% and accelerated feature delivery
               <br><br>
               • Developed a CI/CD pipeline with k6 smoke testing plus Prometheus and Grafana dashboards; enabled performance trend tracking and automated alerts
               <br><br>
               • Built and deployed a RAG microservice using LangChain to process unstructured and tabular data, generate embeddings, and construct a knowledge graph; cut data retrieval time by 40%
               <br><br>
               • Reduced token cost by 44% via Helicone monitoring, intent-based model routing, and Redis caching; leveraged RAGAS and prompt tuning to boost answer faithfulness and context precision
